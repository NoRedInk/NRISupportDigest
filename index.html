  <h1>2020 Back-to-School Support Digest</h1>
  <p>
  üëã Hi everyone, and welcome to the Support Digest for Back-to-School 2020! For folks new to NoRedInk, the Customer Support team sends out a digest regularly to share information about what our users are experiencing. <br>
  <br>
With many teachers relying on NoRedInk to support students during remote learning, we‚Äôve seen a record number of tickets this back-to-school season <strong>(August, September, and October.)</strong> We‚Äôve organized this digest into multiple sections: <strong><a class="header" href="#stats">support ticket stats</a></strong>, <strong><a class="header" href="#feedback">feedback from users</a></strong>, <strong><a class="header" href="#improvements">improvements to user needs</a></strong>, <strong><a class="header" href="#bugs">outstanding issues</a></strong>, and <strong><a class="header" href="#hc">insights from the Help Center</a></strong>. Let‚Äôs dive in!

  <h2>Back to school highlights</h2>
<p>
  With the increase in site usage, we saw record high ticket volume this back-to-school season. Between August-October, we‚Äôve received 46.3% more tickets compared to the same period of time last year (3697).
  Despite having longer wait times (we doubled our median first time reply for teachers compared to last back to school), our teacher CSAT remained high at 98%, which is the same CSAT score as last year.
</p>
  <h2>COVID impact</h2>
  <p>
  In August and September, we saw an increase in the rate of tickets being created weekly per active teacher compared to last year (<strong>16.8 tickets created for every 1000 teachers.</strong>)
  Due to the impact of COVID on the classroom, teachers have been asking new questions and a lot more questions about using NoRedInk as they adapt to distance learning.
  The highest influx of tickets came in September, while teachers were first signing up, creating classes, and adding students in NoRedInk.
<br>
<br>
  Since October, we‚Äôve been seeing ticket volume decline and the rate of tickets created per active teacher declining too: (<strong>11.6 tickets per 1000 teachers.</strong>)
  During the first months of back to school, teachers needed a lot of support in the initial set up and onboarding on NoRedInk.
  At present, we are seeing less tickets created and a larger portion of teachers and students writing in who are already engaged with NRI activities.

  <h1>üôè <a name="feedback"></a>Feedback and User Needs</h1>
  <h3>Teachers have a hard time making sure students can successfully join their NoRedInk classes.</h3>
  <blockquote><em>"This is my first year using NRI. When I registered my students (which was not as intuitive as I thought it would be, but one of my students helped us-- including me-- out, as I thought that they would NOT need to enter a code when they initially registered, but some had to do so."</em></blockquote>
  <h4><strong>The accidental creation of duplicate accounts can also cause problems when students start working from multiple accounts.</strong></h4>
    <blockquote><em>"I would like to make a suggestion that you allow us to merge student accounts. I have had several students make a different account when they could remember their password (even though I have told them repeatedly to NOT do that). I don't want them to lose all their work..."</em></blockquote>
  <h3>With distance learning causing more frequent changes to rosters, there is an increasing need for teachers to be able to easily move students between classes.</h3>
  <p>While the most ideal scenario for teachers is to keep students‚Äô account progress in tact, the next best thing could be a more user-friendly way to move students in the UI with information without having to ask students to join again. </p>
  <blockquote><em>"As a middle school teacher, students schedules change and sometimes I need to move a student from one class to another. It would be really helpful to have an option to move a student from one class to another without having to have them sign up for the other class."</em></blockquote>
  <h3>Teachers need more data about student activity on NoRedInk so that they can better understand and support what students are working on remotely. </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Teachers may need to monitor student activity on NRI to fulfill specific school/instructional requirements</li>
    <li>Teachers want to know exactly where students are getting ‚Äòstuck‚Äô and how to help</li>
    <li>Teachers would benefit from student activity data across all types of assignments as well as independent practice</li>

    <h3>Clever improvements, just in time!</h3>
    <p>Team Zen‚Äôs work on Clever improvements over the summer has made a big impact on creating a smoother experience for teachers and students using Clever this school year.
      In August, we saw Clever tickets being <a class="link" href="https://noredink.slack.com/archives/C9XRZ5GG0/p1600445723002300" target="_blank">created at a lower rate</a> compared to last year despite the fact that we have almost doubled the number of Clever schools we are supporting.</p>

      <h3>Last month, Kraken resolved a number of longstanding bugs in the quiz engine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Students will no longer <a class="link" href="https://github.com/NoRedInk/customer-issues/issues/91" target="_blank">be marked incorrect</a> because of superfluous spaces in their answers</li>
        <li>The MLA tutorial <a class="link" href="https://github.com/NoRedInk/customer-issues/issues/38" target="_blank">no longer has an error</a></li>

    <h1>üí°<a name="hc"></a>Help Center Performance</h1>
    <p>Overall, we've seen a notable increase in site traffic for the Help Center. Compared to 2019, in 2020 there has been a <strong>54% increase</strong> in overall unique pageviews during the back-to-school season. <strong>(501,630 compared to 324,921 last year)</strong></p>
    <h2>Article performance</h2>
    <p>Over the summer, the Support team reorganized and renamed much of the content in the Help Center to help teachers discover relevant content more easily. As it turns out, we've seen many of the articles in the newly created sections receive some of the highest pageview counts in the Help Center!</p>

    <h2>Notable insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>During August/September, teachers searched for how to delete assignments in the Help Center 288 times, leading us to believe that the "Archive" option was unclear.
        Thanks to Dansby, Kristine, and Christa, "archive/unarchive" became "delete/restore" in the UI, and searches for how to delete an assignment <strong>dropped to 27 in October</strong>.
       </li>
      <li>During back-to-school 2019, the "Prompts for Writing Assignments" article was one of the most viewed articles with 19,291 pageviews.
        This has dropped to 470 pageviews in 2020, leading us to believe that teachers have <strong>enjoyed being able to find prompts directly in the Assignment Library.</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Video views</h2>
    <p>Videos are a new frontier for our team, and we're continuing to think about how we can measure their effectiveness! Our top videos for back-to-school are below.</p>
